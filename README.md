# crawling-with-instaloader
with instaloader, we can download pictures (or videos) along with their captions and other metadata from Instagram and it is free open source software written Python

in this project (@mauraqoonitah with @adinigufroni), we crawl an instagram account (@sobatgadgetcom on instagram) and get all the followers from this account.
and other metadata from @sobatgadget's followers such as:
1. username account 
2. post (caption)
3. hashtag
4. likes
5. comments

# Installation
with Python installed, do:
```python
pip install instaloader
```
1. We should log in to an instagram account
2. then we choose our account target
3. from the account target's followers, we can get all the information from each follower's post such as id, caption, hashtags, number of likes, and comments.

Then we run the codes in IDLE and the result will give us the datas that we want.
```code
```
